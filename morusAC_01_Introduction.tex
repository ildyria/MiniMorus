\subsubsection*{Our Contributions.}
Our main result is the existence of a linear trail linking ciphertext bits spanning five consecutive encryption steps. As a consequence of this trail, we exhibit a biased linear combination of ciphertext bits, which holds across any given sequence of five consecutive encryption steps. Technically, this assumes that the inner state of the cipher at the start of the trail is uniformly random, but this is a fair assumption since the inner state should be indistinguishable from uniform randomness by design. Moreover, that is the only assumption required; in particular, the secret key or the nonce used to initialize the inner state of MORUS are irrelevant: the bias is independent of their value.
